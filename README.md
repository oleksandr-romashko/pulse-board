# üü¢ PulseBoard Monitoring (working title)

**PulseBoard Monitoring** is a web application for checking the health of services, IT infrastructure, and IoT devices.

The first goal is a personal all-in-one tool to watch the status of study or pet projects ‚Äî perfect for a single page on a laptop / lab server, a wall monitor, or a smart-TV dashboard.

## üí° Project Overview

The system lets you:

* Centrally monitor health endpoints of any service.
* Display live statuses as cards or a table, with green or red indicators (background, dot, or other highlight) depending on the response.
* Run in a headless console mode that continuously redraws a colorized table, giving a terminal-based status board.

## üéØ Key Use Cases

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Service Monitoring (MVP)

* Health-check any HTTP endpoint with configurable polling interval, timeout, and retry count.
* Status shown as **cards, list rows on a web page** (green = healthy, red = down, other colors optional for intermediate states).
* Headless console mode for **terminal dashboards**. Colorized table that updates in place.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ IT-Infrastructure Topology

* Visualize **network-node style topology** to show relationships between servers, containers, and services.
* Highlight exactly where a failure occurs in the chain.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ IoT & Sensors

* Group devices by zone or complex site.
* Gather metrics such as temperature, humidity, or load via HTTP or MQTT.
* Potential future view: **SCADA-like dashboard** with interactive elements. (Device control is an intriguing‚Äîbut future‚Äîpossibility.)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Geo Dashboard

* Interactive map (Leaflet/Mapbox) with pins or fixed cards for data centers, cameras, power plants, etc.
* Switch between map and card/table views; flexible layout.
* Optional live camera snapshots or streams.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

* **Backend**: FastAPI + Pydantic
* **Frontend**:
    * **Stage 1 (all-in-one tool)** ‚Äì Server-side rendering (Jinja2)
    * **Stage 2** ‚Äì React/Next.js for richer UI components
* **Data**:
    * MVP ‚Äì JSON/SQLite configuration
    * Optional ‚Äì PostgreSQL + PostGIS for geo features
* **Protocols**: HTTP health checks; WebSocket support for real-time updates; (later) MQTT for IoT;  other additional protocols.
* **Deployment**: Docker container; optional PyPI CLI package.
* **UI & Interactivity**:
    * Smooth status transitions (e.g., fading or sliding color changes when a service goes from green ‚Üí red).
    * Subtle hover animations on cards and map pins to guide user focus.
    * Optional real-time pulse effect (a soft glow or ‚Äúheartbeat‚Äù around a card) for services that update frequently.
    * Lightweight CSS/JS libraries (e.g., Framer Motion or simple CSS transitions) to keep performance high.

## üèÅ Roadmap
**Version	Features**
**v0.1 ‚Äì Core**	Health checks, card/list/table UI, headless console mode
**v0.2 ‚Äì Config UI**	Web CRUD for adding/editing services
**v0.3 ‚Äì Alerts**	Email/Telegram/toast notifications
**v0.4 ‚Äì Grouping & Topology**	Node-style network topology, grouping, relationships
**v0.5 ‚Äì Geo**	Interactive map and location data
**v1.0 ‚Äì Public**	Complete documentation and optional SaaS offering

### Beyond MVP

After v0.3, direction will depend on demand:

* **IT-Infrastructure deep dive** ‚Äì richer network monitoring, advanced protocols.
* **Geo Dashboard expansion** ‚Äì a ‚Äúwow-effect‚Äù feature set and possible move into adjacent markets.
* **IoT/SCADA view or device control** if it proves valuable.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Hosting & Possible SaaS Model

* **Cloud deployment** is separate from the local all-in-one tool.
* Public dashboards could be offered as a **freemium SaaS**:
    * e.g., monitor up to 10 endpoints for free.
    * Paid tiers unlock more endpoints, additional protocols, user authentication, and premium dashboards.

## üìú License

* Repository will be public for core functionality (MIT).
* Advanced or commercial modules may have a separate license if the SaaS path is pursued.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Create the GitHub repository `pulse-board`.
2. Add this `README` as the base documentation.
3. Open an issue ‚Äú**MVP v0.1**‚Äù with subtasks:
    * Initialize FastAPI project.
    * Implement core health-check logic.
    * (Optional) Sketch UI/UX mock-ups in Figma or Excalidraw.
    * Build Jinja2 UI with card/list/table views.
